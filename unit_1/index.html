		<h1>Branding. UX. Stationery.</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the digital diary of Stephanie Rachmeler.</p>
		
		<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
		<p>Isn't it interesting that that question is often answered with our profession? We are defined by what we do. I am a graphic designer. Recently, I was contracting with a company for almost two years when the funds ran out and I was laid off. While that doesn't change my abilities or knowledge, it still felt like a hit to me as a person. "Am I still a designer when I'm not designing (on a consistent basis)?"
		
		<h2>Why Am I Here?</h2>
		<p>In this involuntary time of discovery, I have realized a lot about myself. I wrongly assumed that, at 33, I had nothing new to learn about myself. I have varying interests, all creative in one way or another, and there were times I felt schizophrenic because I couldn't commit to one. I now realize the one unifying theme: Simplicity.</p>
		<h3>Feeling Limited</h3>
		<p>I have resisted coding and the digital world for as long as possible (we're almost living with the Jetsons and I still want to read the news on paper). While I enjoy a well-designed digital experience, I dislike its intangibility. While I still love paper and other tactile mediums, I'm tired of my digital presence being limited to what I can manipulate in Squarespace or Adobe Portfolio.</p>
		<h3>Visual Clutter</h3>
		<p>I have found that visual clutter in my home had started to affect my ability to concentrate. I was always distracted, because in the back of my mind was the thought "Oh, I need to do X later." There is currently a rise in the minimalist approach to living, as seen in the Netflix documentary Minimalism and the popularity of the book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, among others.</p>
		<h3>The Lightbulb Moment</h3>
		<p>Reducing the clutter (recycling old magazines, culling my closet) and the joy it brought me have now permeated my work life as well. Not only do I think clearer, but I want to impart that same feeling to my clients through my work. Once I realized that coding is 100% organization, a lightbulb went on. It took me a minute but I am now very excited to learn to code.</p>
