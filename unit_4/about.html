		<h2>I Think Business Cards Are Important</h2>
			<p>Why are business cards important? Because relationships matter. “No man is an island” is true both personally but especially professionally. Why should anyone want to work with you over someone equally accomplished? Because they like you better. Why do they like you better? It doesn’t matter. Whatever the reason, you’ve established a relationship and, in doing so, earned his or her loyalty. Loyalty means return customers and new referrals. It’s not something to be taken lightly. Much like a marriage, professional relationships take continuous work. Don’t take it for granted.</p>
			
			<p>Marriage is preceded by dating, and dating begins by first getting noticed. You are awesome at what you do, you keep up with current trends and on top of that you’re a nice person, but Prince Charming is never going to notice you if you don’t stand out from all the other would-be princesses out there.</p>
	
			<p>Enter the business card. This 3.5”x2” piece of paper is all Prince Charming has left of you when the clock strikes midnight. Cinderella’s glass slipper was a pretty unique calling card and so too must your business card be just as unique and memorable an artifact to help customers find you again.</p>
	
			<p>In a sea of overly-used template-designed business cards, what will make yours stand out? Many cards are printed digitally for its cost-effectiveness. However, if your card is 2 colors or less, consider offset printing. Offset, like letterpress, uses a plate to transfer the ink to the paper. This gives you solid coverage of color versus the dot pattern (poor) digital printing does. You put effort in your appearance. Do the same for your card.</p>

			<p>Here’s something to consider: Cognition follows a three step sequence - Shape, Color and Form. You’re going to remember the shape of an object first, then it’s color and finally what it says. Consider rounded corners, a unique cut-out, colored stock versus the traditional white, or a specialty printing process. When a potential client is perusing their box o’ cards looking for yours, even if they’ve forgotten your name, they’re going to remember “it’s a dark blue card with yellow edges and rounded corners."</p>

			<p>Every detail counts. Have your business cards custom designed to your business. Doing so tells current and prospective customers that details matter to you and attention to detail is something they can expect doing business with you.</p>
		
			<p>The bottom line: You card should represent the effort you put towards your business, the unparalleled service it offers, and the attention-to-detail that makes your company the right choice for your customers.</p>

			<img src="images/PricingHeader.jpg" alt="Invoices are by far the worst part of working with you" title="An actual message from a client">

			<p>It's true. But to be fair, I don't like discussing money either. It's my least favorite part of the process.</p>

			<p>Candidly, no one ever gets into design for the money. It can be a comfortable existence, don’t get me wrong, but designers are designers for passion first. This may seem a contradictory statement if you’ve ever grumbled over the writing of a check for design work.
			<i>How can a drawing cost so much? </i>The following is a personal example that will hopefully illustrate why.</p>
		
			<p>A former client, during our initial meeting, stated: I don’t understand why typesetting my name in Times New Roman costs $2000. His confusion is understandable. It does not, in fact, cost $2000 to typeset anyone’s name in Times New Roman.</p>
	
			<p>The typesetting is about 20% of your cost, in this case $400. That seems more reasonable, right? Typesetting involves understanding the geometric structure of the typeface, kerning (the space between the letters) and leading (the space between the lines), and the computer skills to manipulate the font and its variables, and export it in the correct formats.</p>
	
			<p>The other 80%, or $1,600 as I explained to him, is the Who? What? When? Where? Why? and How? such as:</p>
	
			<p>
			<ul style="list-style: none;">
				<li>Who are you as a brand?</li>
				<li>Who is your target audience?</li>
				<li>What is your key message to your audience?</li>
				<li>What are your goals?</li>
				<li>What are the goals of your audience?</li>
				<li>What is the problem you are solving?</li>
				<li>What makes your product or service different?</li>
				<li>What does the use of Times New Roman say to your audience?</li>
				<li>What was the catalyst for starting your business?</li>
				<li>When did this catalyst occur?</li>
				<li>Where do you see your business in five years? In ten?</li>
				<li>Where are you located?</li>
				<li>Where is your product or service manufactured?</li>
				<li>Where is your audience?</li>
				<li>Why is your business relevant?</li>
				<li>Why is your solution the best in the market?</li>
				<li>Why should anyone hire your services?</li>
				<li>Why is Times New Roman the best choice for your visual identity?</li>
				<li>How old is your audience?</li>
				<li>How do they feel?</li>
				<li>How do they shop?</li>
				<li>How do they commute?</li>
				<li>How do they vote?</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>The majority of the design fee is paying an outsider with expert-level thinking to come in and work with you on the best possible solution for your given situation. Why? Sometimes it’s nice to have someone who isn’t too close, who can ask the questions that you may have missed.</p>
			
			<p>When you outsource anything, you’re paying for one or both of two reasons: (1) For something you cannot do or (2) For something you do not want to do. Not everyone is a trained designer. Obviously. Our different skill sets make the world go ‘round. You may feel unable to effectively communicate what it is you’re trying to say. Conversely, you may possess similar skills but realize you’re at a point in your business where your time is better spent in other areas and you need to outsource your creative needs. Either way, it’s only fair to pay for expert-level help. Let’s not grumble. <a href="mailto:stephanie.rachmeler@icloud.com">Let's create.</a>
